                    “Grow up!” they would say, as they sit on their haunches, staring at the void. They want everyone
                    else to forsake their inner child, as they did theirs. Not me! I keep mine around. It’s really good at
                    learning, listening and, surprisingly, understanding. It likes to explore and is ruthlessly
                    inquisitive. We work together sometimes. It sometimes whispers strange, unorthodox, often
                    counterintuitive solutions to some of my problems. More often than not, it’s off doing its own
                    thing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I can hold my own too! While I’m new to professional programming, I’ve had my
                    fair share of programming experience. I have a degree from the University
                    of Texas in Biology and a “boot-camp” certification in Web Development from the same institution.
                    To solidify fundamentals I learned in school and bootcamp, I co-designed group projects including a concert-fan matcher based on song listening data, a Cornell Note taking application and a CSS color palette generator.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've been working in the bicycle industry as a mechanic. Out of this, I learned
                    plenty of very useful skills: explaining technical info in an easily digestible format, and watching as blank stares are replaced with a the look of a lightbulb going off, working in a
                    fast-paced environment where attention to detail is tantamount to client safety and
                    constantly learning new procedures and products as they are developed. Now I am looking to pivot and am seeking new opportunities. I hope to bring with me my tangible and intangible experience as a new junior software/web developer from an outside field!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond work, one might find my inner child and I exploring the weird corners
                    of Wikipedia, talking about music with friends, cooking and exploring the outside
                    world on bicycles then crashing them into trees and rocks (often unintentionally).
